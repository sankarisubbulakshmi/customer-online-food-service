# Usage
This dataset is useful for analyzing customer behavior, predicting engagement levels, and understanding factors that influence customer satisfaction in online food services.

# Learning outcomes
The customer engagement dataset for online food service you've provided can be used for both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, depending on the analysis goals:

Supervised Learning: If the goal is to predict or classify customer engagement (Output column) based on other features such as age, gender, marital status, occupation, etc., 
then supervised learning techniques would be appropriate. For example, you could build a classification model to predict whether a customer will engage with the online food service (Yes/No).

Unsupervised Learning: If the goal is to explore patterns within the data, segment customers based on their demographics or behavior, or understand relationships between different attributes 
(e.g., clustering customers based on location and feedback sentiments), then unsupervised learning techniques would be suitable.
